# ES6

# .center[Content]



1. What is ES6? 
2. Variables
3. const und let
4. Super Strings
5. Arrow Functions
6. Promise

---
# .center[What is ES6?]
.left[
- Short for ECMAScript Version 6
- ES is JavaScript after standardisation through ECMA International
- JavaScript is the most popular implementation
	- Others are SpiderMonkey, V8 and ActionScript]
---
# .center[Variables]
.left[- declaration through 'var' is prone to issues
	- 'var' is function-scoped
	- Variables need to be hoisted in code
	- Hoisted variables may lead to reference issues]

.left[- No real const variables
	- Need of help functions
	- Leads to bloating code]

---
# .center[const and let]
.center[There are two new ways of creating a variable]
.left[- const
	- 'const' declaration creates a read-only named constant
	- No need for help functions]
.left[- let
	- 'let' is like 'var' only scoped in block and not in function]
---
name: string

# .center[Super Strings...]
.left[- are encapsulated in ` (Grave accent)
- don't need to escape Quotation Marks
- are capable of multiline Strings without escapes and line joins
- can now use JavaScript, without the need to escape, through the use of ${}]
---
template: string

```javascript
var template = `
  <div>
    <h3>Good Morning ${name}</h3>
    <p>
      That item will cost you
      <b>${amount*price}</b>
      dollars.
    </p>
  </div>`
```
---
name: functions
	    
# .center[Arrow Functions]
.left[- Shorter version to write functions
less syntax/overhead
- Syntax
	- (brackets with parameters)=>{function}]
---
template: functions
 
```javascript	    
//regular
function (x) {
    return x * 2;
}
//arrow style
(x) => {
    return x * 2;
}
//shorter
(x) => { return x * 2; }
//shortest	    
(x) => x * 2
```
---
name: promise

# .center[Promise]
.left[- JavaScript doesn't have threads 
- works with the help of Arrow Functions
- Promises is a new object which helps to synchronize processes
- Promises.all() can take an array of promises and creat a new promise which waits for the array to finish]
