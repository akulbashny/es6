# .center[What is ES6?]
.left[
- Short for ECMAScript Version 6
- ES is JavaScript after standardisation through ECMA International
- JavaScript is the most popular implementation
	- others are SpiderMonkey, V8 and ActionScript]
---
# .center[Variables]
.left[- declaration through 'var' is prone to issues
	- 'var' is function-scoped
	- variables need to be hoisted in code
	- hoisted variables may lead to reference issues]

.left[- no real const variables
	- need of help functions
	- leads to bloating code]

---
# .center[const and let]
.center[There are two new ways of creating a variable]
.left[- const
	- const declaration creates a read-only named constant
	- no need for help functions]
.left[- let
	- 'let' is like 'var' only scoped in block and not in function]
---
# .center[Super Strings...]
.left[- are encapsulated in ` (Grave accent)
- don't need to escape Quotation Marks
- are capable of multiline Strings without escapes and line joins
- can now use JavaScript, without the need to escape, through the use of ${}]
